<p>By default Shadow repeater gets invoked on the 5th repeater request you make and it requires a parameter or header to be changed. You simply try to hack a target by altering the request in some way. In the background Shadow repeater will send variations and look for differences in the response. When it's found something interesting it will send it to the organiser for inspection.</p>
